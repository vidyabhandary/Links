20. **Browser Rendering Process** (Dec 15, 2024)
    [Insightful and detailed article on the browser rendering process](https://abhisaha.com/blog/exploring-browser-rendering-process/)

![Pictorial representation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vidyabhandary/Links/refs/heads/main/imgs/rendering.jpg)

    TL;DR (From the article)

1. DNS Lookup: When a URL is entered, the browser performs a DNS lookup to convert the domain name into an IP address, allowing it to locate the website’s server.

2. TCP/TLS Handshake: The browser initiates a TCP handshake to establish a connection with the server. If the site is secure (HTTPS), a TLS handshake is also conducted to encrypt data transmission.

3. HTTP Request/Response Cycle: After establishing a connection, the browser sends an HTTP request for the website’s content, and the server responds with the necessary HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.

4. Tokenization: The browser reads the HTML response as raw data, converting it into individual characters and then tokens (e.g., <html>, <body>), which help the browser understand the document’s structure.

5. DOM Tree Creation: The browser builds the DOM (Document Object Model) tree, a hierarchical representation of the HTML document’s structure, with each node representing an element or text content.

6. CSSOM Tree Creation: The browser parses the CSS to create the CSSOM (CSS Object Model) tree, which represents the styles associated with the HTML document’s elements.

7. Render Tree Creation: The DOM and CSSOM trees combine to form the Render Tree, a visual representation of the page’s layout that includes only visible elements and their computed styles.

8. Layout: The browser calculates the exact size and position of each element on the screen, based on CSS properties like margins, padding, and positioning (e.g., static, absolute).

9. Painting: Using the Render Tree, the browser paints pixels onto the screen, filling in colors, images, borders, and shadows as defined by the CSS styles.

I recently completed my 1.5-year streak on Duolingo (just 5 minutes a day—let’s call it dabbling rather than mastery 😅. Yes my Duolingo app icon is on fire !!!)

It feels almost serendipitous to come across this article about how Duolingo slashed cloud costs. One jaw-dropping stat? After the refactor of a legacy service, they uncovered 2.1 billion unnecessary API calls… every single day! 😱

Unconventional technique for a peaceful weekend with a chaos-monkey type self-healing, pragmatic engineering on a Friday afternoon.

How?

- Resizing cluster to meet max capacity
- Randomly kill a few instances every 15 minutes 

Takeaway - Sometimes production incidents can be problem solved to align with quality of life.
